#  Given a string, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of characters. If there are multiple possible solutions, return any of them.

# For example, given the string tweet, return tteew. eettw would also be acceptable.

strings = ["tweet", "success", "balloon", "committee"]

def sort_rep_char(string):

# sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of characters
    indiv_char = list(set(string))
    sorted_repetitions = sorted([char*(string.count(char)) for char in indiv_char], key=len, reverse=True)

    return "".join(sorted_repetitions)


## TEST 

for string in strings:

    sort_rep_char(string)
